/*
Description

Given a time signature (as a string), you must find the amount of quarter notes that can be fit into one measure, which will be returned as 
an unsigned integer. If a non-integer number of quarter notes can be fit into a measure, the value should be floored. DO NOT RETURN A NON 
INTEGER.

The Given Time Signature:
Will not be malformed
Will have a top number below 4096
Will have a bottom number below 256

All valid time signatures must have a bottom number that is a power of 2. If the given signature is invalid, return None in Python, null 
in TypeScript, return -1 in C.

If less then one quarter note can be fit in a measure, return 0;

Examples:
"3/4" → 3
"7/8" → 3
"11/8" → 5
"10/7" → None/null/-1
"3/16" → 0
*/

export function findQuarterNotes(timeSignature: string): number | null {
  const [topStr, bottomStr] = timeSignature.split("/");
  const top = Number(topStr);
  const bottom = Number(bottomStr);

  if (bottom <= 0 || (bottom & (bottom - 1)) !== 0) {
    return null;
  }

  const quarterNotes = Math.floor(top * (4 / bottom));

  return quarterNotes < 1 ? 0 : quarterNotes;
}
