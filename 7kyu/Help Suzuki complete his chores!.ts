Description

Suzuki has a long list of chores required to keep the monastery in good order. Each chore can be completed 
independently of the others and assigned to any student. Knowing there will always be an even number of chores 
and that the number of students isn't limited, Suzuki needs to assign two chores to each student in a way which 
minimizes the total duration of the day's work.

For example, with the list of chores [1, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 6, 4, 2, 2, 2, 9], he'll need 6 students whose total 
workload will be: [7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 11] (as for [5+2, 4+4, 6+2, 8+2, 1+9, 9+2]). In this case, the maximal workload 
is minimized to 11 (=9+2. Keep in mind two chores must be assigned to each student involved).

Input/output
Input: 10 ≤ chores length ≤ 30, chores length is always even.
Output: array of workloads, in ascending order.
