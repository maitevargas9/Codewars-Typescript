Description

Here are some classic Christmas cracker jokes.

There is a made up API URL (http://great.jokes/christmas) that you can call to a get list of Christmas jokes in JSON format.

Your challenge
Write an async function which takes an apiUrl and jokeId which returns a promise.
The data will need to be filtered to get the specified joke by id.
When you got the joke it should be accessible through a simple API of saySetup and sayPunchLine methods.

Handle error cases
If a joke can't be found throw an error message in this format new Error('No jokes found id: {jokeId}').
Getting jokes from a another API URL may return a different data shape, throw this error message new Error('No jokes at url: {url}') for an unexpected shape.
Throw error in a promise style

Info
Get the data using the mocked fetch(url) function, which implements the basics of the fetch api. Learn about fetch. Learn about async/await.

Joke data shape:
{
  jokes: [{ 
    id: 101,
    setup: "Who is Santa's favorite singer?",
    punchLine: "Elf-is Presley!"
  },
...moreJokes]
// Use for your tests ^^
*/

import { fetch } from "./preloaded";

type Joke = {
  id: number;
  setup: string;
  punchLine: string;
};

type JokeResponse = {
  jokes: Joke[];
};

export async function sayJoke(
  apiUrl: string,
  jokeId: number
): Promise<{
  saySetup: () => string;
  sayPunchLine: () => string;
}> {
  const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
  const data: unknown = await response.json();

  if (
    typeof data !== "object" ||
    data === null ||
    !("jokes" in data) ||
    !Array.isArray((data as JokeResponse).jokes)
  ) {
    throw new Error(`No jokes at url: ${apiUrl}`);
  }

  const jokes = (data as JokeResponse).jokes;

  const joke = jokes.find((j: Joke) => j.id === jokeId);

  if (!joke) {
    throw new Error(`No jokes found id: ${jokeId}`);
  }

  return {
    saySetup: () => joke.setup,
    sayPunchLine: () => joke.punchLine
  };
}
