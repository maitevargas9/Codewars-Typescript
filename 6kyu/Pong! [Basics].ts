Lets play some Pong!

pong
For those who don't know what Pong is, it is a simple arcade game where two players can move their paddles to hit a ball towards the
opponent's side of the screen, gaining a point for each opponent's miss. You can read more about it here.

Task:
You must finish the Pong class. It has a constructor which accepts the maximum score a player can get throughout the game, and a method 
called play. This method determines whether the current player hit the ball or not, i.e. if the paddle is at the sufficient height to hit 
it back. There're 4 possible outcomes: player successfully hits the ball back, player misses the ball, player misses the ball and his opponent 
reaches the maximum score winning the game, either player tries to hit a ball despite the game being over. You can see the input and output 
description in detail below.

"Play" method input:
ball position - The Y coordinate of the ball
player position - The Y coordinate of the centre(!) of the current player's paddle

"Play" method output:
One of the following strings:
"Player X has hit the ball!" - If the ball "hits" the paddle
"Player X has missed the ball!" - If the ball is above/below the paddle
"Player X has won the game!" - If one of the players has reached the maximum score
"Game Over!" - If the game has ended when the play method is called

Important notes:
Players take turns hitting the ball, always starting the game with the Player 1.
The paddles are 7 pixels in height.
The ball is 1 pixel in height.

Example
let game = new Pong(2); // Here we say that the score to win is 2
game.play(50, 53)  -> "Player 1 has hit the ball!";     // Player 1 hits the ball
game.play(100, 97) -> "Player 2 has hit the ball!";     // Player 2 hits it back
game.play(0, 4)    -> "Player 1 has missed the ball!";  // Player 1 misses so Player 2 gains a point
game.play(25, 25)  -> "Player 2 has hit the ball!";     // Player 2 hits the ball
game.play(75, 25)  -> "Player 2 has won the game!";     // Player 1 misses again. Having 2 points Player 2 wins, so we return the corresponding string
game.play(50, 50)  -> "Game Over!";                     // Another turn is made even though the game is already over
