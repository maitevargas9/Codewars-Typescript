Description

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.

I would like for you to write me a function that, when given a number n (n >= 1 ), 
returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For example: nthFibo(4) == 2
Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each 
subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
*/

export function nthFibo(n: number): number {
  return n < 3 ? n - 1 : nthFibo(n - 1) + nthFibo(n - 2);
}
